# Air-PianoðŸŽ¹

Air-Piano is a hand-tracking MIDI controller that lets you play chords in the D scale using just your fingers and a webcam. It uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pygame's MIDI module to detect hand gestures and play corresponding musical notes.

ðŸŽ¯ Features

Hand Tracking: Detects fingers using OpenCV & cvzone.

MIDI Output: Sends MIDI signals to simulate piano sounds.

Automatic Sustain: Notes sustain for 2 seconds before stopping.

D Scale Chords: Plays chords mapped to different finger positions.


TLDR : This project uses computer vision and MIDI synthesis to play D-scale chords based on hand gestures. It employs OpenCV, cvzone, and pygame.midi to detect finger positions and trigger corresponding chords, sustaining them for 2 seconds before stopping automatically.
